# Restore a HoneyHive instance from a backup made by scripts/backup.sh.
# DESTRUCTIVE: replaces the current database and .env outright. Meant for
# disaster recovery (lost/corrupted host) or standing up a replacement
# server from another instance's backup — not for everyday use.
#
#   ./scripts/restore.sh backups/20260909T120000Z
#
# What it does, in order:
#   1. Refuses to run without an explicit "yes, overwrite everything" typed
#      confirmation (skip with --yes for unattended/scripted DR).
#   2. Stops web/worker/beat (keeps db/redis containers up, since pg_dump's
#      restore target — the running db service — still needs to be reachable).
#   3. Drops and recreates the target database, then loads db.sql.gz into it.
#   4. Replaces .env (the current one is saved alongside as .env.pre-restore
#      first, never silently discarded).
#   5. Starts the stack back up (migrate → web/worker/beat), same as
#      scripts/start.sh.
#
# This does NOT install/rebuild the app itself — run this against a checkout
# already on the version the backup was taken from (or upgrade.sh afterward).
