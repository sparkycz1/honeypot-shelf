"""Proactively upgrade every stored secret still in the legacy Fernet
(AES-128) format to the current AES-256-GCM one (`app.core.security`).

Optional — `decrypt_secret` already reads both formats transparently
forever, so nothing breaks by never running this. It exists for a
deployment that would rather not carry any AES-128 ciphertext at all going
forward, e.g. before a security review. Every value is re-encrypted under
the same `ENCRYPTION_KEY` (unchanged) — this is a format upgrade, not a
key rotation.

Usage (inside the running `web` container):
    docker compose exec web python scripts/reencrypt_secrets.py
    docker compose exec web python scripts/reencrypt_secrets.py --dry-run

Touches every `*_encrypted` column across the app: `Honeypot.secret_encrypted`,
`SSHIdentity.private_key_encrypted` / `pending_private_key_encrypted`,
`AppSettings.ldap_bind_password_encrypted` / `oidc_client_secret_encrypted`
/ `netbird_setup_key_encrypted` / `wireguard_config_encrypted`,
`User.totp_secret_encrypted`. Idempotent — running it again finds nothing
left to do.
