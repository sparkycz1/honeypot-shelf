# Pull the latest Honeypot Shelf release and rebuild/redeploy the running stack.
#
# Run this from the git checkout on the server, as whichever user normally
# runs `docker compose` here:
#
#   ./scripts/upgrade.sh
#
# What it does, in order:
#   1. Refuses to run with uncommitted local changes, or if this isn't a
#      git checkout at all (a downloaded tarball can't be `git pull`ed).
#   2. `git fetch` + `git pull --ff-only` on the current branch — fails
#      loudly instead of creating a merge commit or silently diverging.
#   3. Adds whatever `.env.example` variables the newly-pulled version
#      introduced but this deployment's `.env` predates (scripts/env_sync.py
#      — only ever appends what's missing, never touches an existing line).
#   4. Detects whether the bundled Caddy reverse proxy is currently running
#      and rebuilds/restarts with the same compose file combination, so it
#      doesn't get silently dropped.
#   5. `docker compose build` (stamped with GIT_COMMIT so the Settings page
#      can show exactly which commit is running — see app/core/version.py)
#      then `docker compose up -d` — the `migrate` service runs
#      automatically as part of the `web`/`worker` dependency chain (see
#      docker-compose.yml) and must complete successfully before either of
#      them starts. There's no separate "run migrations" step.
#   6. Prints `docker compose ps` so you can see everything came back up.
#
# Postgres/Redis/Caddy images are pinned to exact versions in
# docker-compose.yml and are NOT touched by this script — bumping those is
# a deliberate, separate step (see the wiki: Installation, "Updating").
