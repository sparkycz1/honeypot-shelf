"""Interactive setup wizard for a new HoneyHive deployment — the
recommended way to configure and start one for the first time.

Usage (from a fresh git checkout, before anything else):
    python scripts/setup.py

What it does, in order: copies `.env.example` to `.env`, fills in every
secret (`SECRET_KEY`, `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`,
`REDIS_PASSWORD`, `INFORM_TOKEN`, `INGEST_TOKEN`) with freshly generated
random values, asks a handful of questions (timezone, whether to use the
bundled Caddy reverse proxy and its domain/email if so, whether the app's
own port should only accept local connections, the background-check
intervals, the superadmin account's password — or auto-generates one — and
the host port to publish), writes `.env`, brings the stack up with `docker
compose`, waits for the app to become healthy, generates and applies the
first Alembic migration if none exists yet, and creates the first
superadmin account.

If `.env` already exists, declining to overwrite it doesn't abort anymore
— this tops it up instead (`scripts/env_sync.py`: adds whatever
`.env.example` variables this deployment's `.env` predates, touching
nothing already there) and just starts the stack against the existing
file, no secrets regenerated and no new admin account created. Useful for
re-running this script after `git pull` on a deployment that was never
switched to `scripts/upgrade.sh`.

Pure standard library — no dependency on this project's own virtualenv, so
it runs with a bare system `python3` before anything has been installed.
See wiki/Installation.md for what this does step by step, and for the
manual alternative if you'd rather configure everything by hand instead.
