## Screenshots/video

If applicable, add screenshots or a screen recording — mark the area
that's affected.

## Environment

- **Honeypot Shelf version**: the `vX.Y.Z` shown in the site footer (or `git rev-parse HEAD` if running from a checkout)
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose — plain, or with `docker-compose.caddy.yml` / `docker-compose.vpn.yml`?
- **Browser**: [e.g. Chrome 128, Firefox, Safari] — desktop or mobile?
- **Auth method involved, if relevant**: local / LDAP / OIDC
- **Honeypot OS, if this is about a specific honeypot**: [e.g. Raspberry Pi OS, Debian, Ubuntu]

## Relevant logs

`docker compose logs web` (or `worker`/`beat`/`vpn` if more relevant) —
paste just the lines around when it happened, not the whole log.
Double-check there's no password/token/API key in what you paste.
