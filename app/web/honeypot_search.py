    it's portable — it compiles to native `ILIKE` on Postgres and a
    `lower(...)`-based equivalent elsewhere (e.g. SQLite, used in tests).

    Tag names are matched here (loosely, substring, same as everything
    else this checks) rather than only through the dedicated exact-match
    `apply_tag_filter` below, so the plain search box alone is enough to
    find "honeypots tagged prod" without a separate tag picker control —
    the honeypot list's own UI relies on exactly this to fold tag search
    into its one search field; see partials/honeypot_search_form.html.

    *every one* of them. Shared by the web honeypot list
    (`app/web/routes/honeypots.py`) and its REST equivalent
    (`app/web/routes/api_v1.py`) so the two filter identically.

    `"and"` is one `.any()` clause per tag, chained as separate `.where()`
    calls rather than combined in one `and_(...)` — SQLAlchemy already ANDs
    successive `.where()` calls together, and each `.any()` needs its own
    independent correlated EXISTS subquery (the same honeypot must match
    each one separately; a single subquery checking for several tag names
