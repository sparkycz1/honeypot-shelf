"""The interactive web terminal's WebSocket endpoint — the byte-relay half
of the feature (`app/web/routes/honeypots.py`'s `terminal_page` serves the
page shell that connects here).

**Why this can't just use `require_permission`/`app.auth.middleware` like
every other route**: `app.auth.middleware.require_auth` is registered via
`@app.middleware("http")` in `app.main` — Starlette only ever invokes
`http`-scoped middleware for `scope["type"] == "http"` requests, and never
for `"websocket"` ones. A WebSocket connection reaches this handler having
gone through *no* auth check at all. This module therefore re-implements,
by hand, the same two checks every other page gets for free:

1. A valid session cookie, via the exact same `app.auth.sessions.
   get_valid_session` the HTTP middleware itself calls (same revocation/
   expiry/`is_active` semantics — nothing new here, just called from a
   different place).
2. Write access (`User.can_write()`) on that session's user, plus company
   scope on the specific honeypot (`app.auth.scope.can_write_honeypot`) —
   the single most powerful thing this app can do (arbitrary command
   execution as whatever user/sudo rights the honeypot's configured
   account has).

Either failing closes the socket with `1008` (policy violation) *before*
accepting the connection and before anything SSH-related is attempted —
never accept-then-fail, which would let a client believe it has a live
terminal for a moment.

**Protocol**: binary WebSocket frames carry raw terminal bytes in both
directions (client keystrokes in, remote PTY output out); text frames carry
JSON control messages — currently just `{"type": "resize", "cols": .., "rows": ..}`
from the client, and `{"type": "error", "message": ..}` from the server for
a failure that happens before there's a PTY to relay bytes from at all.

**Session lifecycle**: `TERMINAL_SESSION_MAX_SECONDS` (2 hours) is a hard
cap on one session's wall-clock duration, closed server-side regardless of
activity — long enough for a real, uninterrupted admin session (installing
something, chasing down a problem, editing several files), short enough
that a forgotten/abandoned browser tab against this app's most powerful
capability doesn't hold an authenticated, potentially root-capable SSH
connection open indefinitely. There's no separate idle timeout on top of
it. The SSH connection and process are always torn down in a `finally`
block — on a clean disconnect, an error, or the hard cap firing — so there
is never a leaked SSH connection on any exit path.

Only the session's start and end are audit-logged (`honeypot.terminal.open`/
`.close`, with duration on close) — not keystrokes or output, which would
mean recording everything typed/seen in a potentially root-capable shell,
secrets included. This matches how the rest of this app treats "which SSH
round trip happened, by whom" as the audit-worthy fact, not a full
transcript of what it did (see `app/audit.py`'s module docstring).
