"""Impersonation ("sign in as another account") — superadmin-only.

Deliberately its own module, not folded into `app.web.routes.users`
(superadmin-only, but so is everything else there): editing accounts is
one trust level, silently *acting as* one of them is a materially bigger
one. Ported from an identical debcontrol change (`user.impersonate`,
its own permission there) — this app has no roles/permissions (see
`app/db/models/user.py`'s module docstring), so the equivalent gate is
simply "you must already be a superadmin," and the target of an
impersonation may never itself be a superadmin (no admin-on-admin
impersonation, no chains — the closest equivalent of debcontrol's "can't
impersonate an account that itself holds user.impersonate").

How it works: starting an impersonation does **not** touch the admin's
own session row — it creates a brand-new `UserSession` for the target
account (tagged `impersonator_id`), swaps the browser's session cookie
over to it, and stashes the admin's own raw session token in a second,
signed, httponly cookie (`impersonation_return`) so it can be handed back
untouched later. Nothing about the admin's original session is revoked or
extended by any of this.

Ending it is folded into the existing `/logout` route (see
`app.web.routes.auth.logout`) rather than a separate endpoint: logging out
of an impersonated session restores the admin's own session instead of
signing them out entirely, exactly like closing a "su" shell — see that
route for the exact fallback behavior if the return ticket has expired or
the original session no longer validates (a plain, full logout).

Every start/stop is audit-logged under both identities
(`user.impersonate.start`/`user.impersonate.stop`), and every action
taken *during* an impersonated session is already audit-logged as usual
under the impersonated account — `request.state.impersonator` (set by
`app.auth.middleware`) is available to any call site that wants to record
who was really behind the wheel, same as the topbar banner uses it purely
for display (see `base.html`).

Deliberately web-only (not in the REST API) — see `api_v1.py`'s
docstring.
