"""Post-onboarding readiness check — did the app's own setup requirements
(`ncurses-term`, and this account's scoped sudo for apt/shutdown/
dmidecode/flatpak+snap — see `app.ssh.onboarding.build_onboarding_command`)
actually take, or did installing/granting one of them fail or get skipped
(no network at onboarding time, a hand-onboarded honeypot that predates one
of these requirements, ...)? Read-only: every check here is a plain
`dpkg -s`/`sudo -n ... --version`-style probe — nothing is installed or
changed by running this.

**A honeypot whose configured account already *is* root never needs any of
the sudo grants at all** — root doesn't need to `sudo` itself, and on many
hardened images root has no usable password for `sudo` to authenticate
with in the first place (a locked/no-password root account, common when
only key-based root login is allowed), so `sudo -n` would fail there even
though the real command it's gating (`apt-get`, `shutdown`, `dmidecode` —
see `app.ssh.updates`/`app.ssh.power`/`app.ssh.facts`) would work fine run
directly. Every sudo-gated probe here is therefore skipped (reported
`ok`) once `id -u` is 0, mirroring the same root-runs-it-directly
fallback those other modules' *real* commands use.
