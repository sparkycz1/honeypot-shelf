"""A thin layer over AsyncSSH for connecting to managed Debian honeypots.

Security principle — no blind "trust on first use":

1. `discover_host_key_fingerprint()` connects to a honeypot ONLY to learn its
   SSH host key fingerprint, and always deliberately aborts before
   authenticating. The fingerprint is shown to an operator, who must verify
   it through a channel outside this application (e.g. the hosting
   provider's console, or `ssh-keygen -lf` run on the honeypot itself) and
   only then explicitly confirm it.
2. Only after that human confirmation is the fingerprint stored against the
   honeypot (`Honeypot.host_key_fingerprint`).
3. Every subsequent connection (`open_connection`) then strictly verifies
   the presented key against that stored fingerprint — a mismatch
   immediately aborts the connection as a possible Man-in-the-Middle
   attack; it is never silently ignored.

`known_hosts=([], [], [])` below (an explicit "no trusted keys, no CA keys,
no revoked keys, and don't touch any known_hosts file" tuple, per AsyncSSH's
own `match_known_hosts()` docs) is NOT the same as `known_hosts=None`, and
the difference matters a lot: passing `None` tells AsyncSSH's connection
itself has no `_trusted_host_keys` set to compare against, which skips
calling `SSHClient.validate_host_public_key()` entirely and accepts
*any* presented key — silently. That would make `_PinnedSSHClient` below
never actually get consulted, meaning `open_connection()` would accept a
different key than the one pinned without ever raising
`HostKeyMismatchError` — a MITM completely undetected, in direct
contradiction to point 3 above. The empty-tuple form keeps an empty (but
non-`None`) trusted-key set, which *does* make AsyncSSH fall through to
the callback for every key. See `test_ssh_client.py`'s
`test_open_connection_rejects_a_different_key_than_the_pinned_one` for the
regression test that would catch this again.

    an interactive shell's locale is whatever the remote account's own

    minimal, non-interactively-provisioned server), which makes ncurses
    apps (htop, less, ...) draw meters/borders with plain ASCII characters

    "C.UTF-8" is a locale every glibc system has built in with no
    `locale-gen` step required, unlike e.g. "en_US.UTF-8". This is a
    best-effort SSH env request, not a guarantee: sshd only forwards
    variables its own `AcceptEnv`/`SetEnv` allows (Debian/Ubuntu's default
    sshd_config allows `LANG`/`LC_*`) — a server that doesn't accept these
    just ignores the request rather than failing the connection.
