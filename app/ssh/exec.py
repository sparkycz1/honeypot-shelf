"""One-shot remote command execution — run a single command, capture its
output and exit status, disconnect.

This is deliberately *not* the interactive terminal machinery
(`app.ssh.client.open_shell_session` + `app.web.routes.terminal_ws`). That
one allocates a PTY and relays a byte stream for the lifetime of a
WebSocket; this one is a plain `exec` channel with a request/response
shape, which is what the `run_command` scheduled action and the "run once
and log" one-shot form need: one command in, exit status and captured
output out, nothing to relay and nothing to keep open.

Its closest sibling is `app.ssh.client.test_connection` (`open_connection`
plus a single `conn.run(...)`) — the same connection handling, the same
strict pinned host-key verification, just with a caller-supplied command
and both timeouts made explicit.

**Nothing in this module decides whether a command is allowed to run.**
Reaching here means an operator with write access has already clicked
Confirm on the literal command text (see `app.web.routes.honeypots`),
exactly as if they had typed it into the browser terminal themselves. The
command is
sent to the remote shell as-is; there is no escaping, filtering, or
allowlisting, because there is no meaningful way to sanitize "arbitrary
shell command" and pretending otherwise would be worse than being explicit
about it.
