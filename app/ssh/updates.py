"""Run (or just check for) system updates on a honeypot: apt, plus flatpak
and snap when either is present.

`run_system_update`: always the same shape — `apt-get update`, then the
chosen upgrade strategy, then `autoremove` and `autoclean`, then (if
installed) `flatpak update` and `snap refresh` — the cleanup and flatpak/
snap steps run unconditionally, even if the apt upgrade step failed, since
they're independently useful and shouldn't be skipped just because apt hit
a problem. Overall success/failure is still judged by the apt step alone
(unchanged from before flatpak/snap support), since that's the one debcontrol
can meaningfully retry or diagnose — flatpak/snap failures still show up in
the stored output for the admin to read.

`check_updates`: a read-only dry run — refreshes the apt cache and reports
how many packages are upgradable (and how many of those are from a
`*-security` suite), plus how many flatpak and snap packages have pending
updates, without installing or upgrading anything.

apt requires root — either the honeypot's configured username *is* root, or
(recommended) it has passwordless sudo for `apt-get` specifically. See the
wiki page "Honeypot Requirements" for a sudoers example. `sudo -n`
(non-interactive) is used throughout: if sudo would need a password, the
command fails immediately with a clear error instead of hanging forever
waiting for input that can never arrive over a non-interactive SSH exec.
flatpak/snap are also run via `sudo -n` for consistency (system-wide
flatpak/snap operations commonly need it too) — see the sudoers example in
the wiki page, which covers all three.

Every privileged step is wrapped by `_with_root_fallback`: try it via
`sudo -n` first, and if that fails (no sudo grant — or no `sudo` binary at
all on a minimal root-only image), run it directly instead. That fallback
only ever matters when the connecting account is already root (an
unprivileged fallback just fails again with its own permission-denied
error, no different from today) — see `app.ssh.facts`'s `dmidecode` probe
for the same idiom, and `app.ssh.readiness` for why root should never be
asked to grant itself sudo in the first place.

Neither flatpak nor snap is required to be installed: every step here is
guarded with `command -v`, so a honeypot without one (or both) simply skips
that part rather than failing.
