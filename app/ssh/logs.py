"""Live log viewing for a managed honeypot — the Logs tab. No persistence:
every view is a fresh, read-only SSH round trip (like the interactive
terminal, just non-interactive and scoped to one command), never stored
anywhere in this app's own DB.

Gated behind write access (see `app.web.routes.honeypots`'s
`_honeypot_tabs`/the Logs routes), not just being logged in the way every
other read-only tab is — reading journal/log-file content is a materially
different trust level than "here's the CPU count," even though it needs no
root: journal output routinely includes auth attempts, cron output, and
application errors that can carry secrets. Same tier as the interactive
terminal, which could already read any of this directly.

The "view an arbitrary file" half is restricted to `LOG_FILE_ALLOWED_PATHS`
(`Settings.log_file_allowed_path_list`) — a UX/scope guardrail for an
account that already has write access (who could read the same file
directly in the terminal anyway), not a hard security boundary against
that account itself; see that setting's own docstring in
`app.core.config`.
