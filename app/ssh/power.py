"""Reboot / shut down a honeypot over SSH.

Fire-and-forget by design: `shutdown` schedules the action and returns
almost immediately, but the SSH connection can legitimately be torn down
mid-response the moment the remote actually starts going down — that's
expected, not a failure, and is treated as such here. Unlike system
updates, there's no persistent run history for this — the existing
per-minute reachability check already shows a honeypot going offline and
(once it's back) online again, which is what actually matters afterwards.

Requires root — same as `app.ssh.updates`; see the wiki page "Managed
Honeypot Requirements" for the sudoers line (`shutdown` needs to be listed
alongside `apt-get`). Same root fallback too: `sudo -n` first, falling
back to running `shutdown` directly if that fails — the only case that
matters in practice is the honeypot's configured account already being
root, where no sudo grant exists (or is even possible, on a root account
with no usable sudo password) but the plain command works fine.

The confirmation step (typing the honeypot's/group's name before this is
even called) lives in the web layer — see `app.web.routes.honeypots` and
`app.web.routes.companies`. This module has no opinion on that; it
just sends the command once asked to.
