"""Cheap honeypot "is it alive" check for the automatic per-minute status
badge, and (see `ReachabilityResult`) the "Availability" history on the
Monitoring tab.

This deliberately does NOT attempt an SSH handshake or authenticate — it's
just a raw TCP connect to the configured SSH port. That's enough to answer
"is something listening there right now" without the cost (or host-key
strictness) of a real SSH connection, and it's what's actually relevant for
an SSH management tool (a host that blocks ICMP but serves SSH should still
show as reachable, and vice versa). Real connectivity, including
authentication, is still verified by the "Test connection" button
(`app.ssh.client.test_connection`), which does the full pinned-host-key
SSH flow.
