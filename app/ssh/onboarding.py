"""Builds the shell script that prepares a fresh, not-yet-managed Debian/
Raspbian honeypot for HoneyHive, run directly over SSH (see
`app.tasks.jobs._run_honeypot_onboarding`, the only caller):

1. Create a dedicated `honeyhive` user (idempotent — `id -u` first).
2. Install this app's own SSH public key into that user's
   `authorized_keys` (idempotent — `grep -qxF` first, same convention as
   `app.tasks.jobs._push_pending_ssh_key`).
3. Grant it passwordless sudo, scoped to exactly what HoneyHive needs
   (`apt-get`, `shutdown`, and `flatpak`/`snap` if either is present) —
   the exact sudoers line documented in wiki/Honeypot-Onboarding.md.
4. Best-effort install `ncurses-term`, so the web Terminal tab gets colors
   and box-drawing without a separate manual step. Its failure (no
   network, offline apt cache) must never fail onboarding itself — only
   steps 1-3 are load-bearing.

Deliberately **not** an actual `ansible-playbook` invocation: that would
need Ansible (and its own dependency tree) added to the worker image just
for this, for no behavioral difference over running the same handful of
idempotent shell commands through the SSH connection this app already has
everywhere else. (The team's own separate Ansible-based imaging/install
runbook, run once when a Pi is first provisioned, is complementary to
this, not replaced by it — see wiki/Honeypot-Onboarding.md.)

Requires connecting as root (or an account that already behaves like
root) — that one-time credential is the whole point of onboarding a
honeypot that has nothing configured for HoneyHive yet, so there is
deliberately no `sudo` escalation anywhere in this script to fall back on
if the connecting account isn't already root.
