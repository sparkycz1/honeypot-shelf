"""Scheduled full backups, kept on the data volume.

Settings → Backup & restore → "Automatic backups": the same passphrase-encrypted file
`app.services.full_backup` writes for a manual download, made every N
hours by `app.tasks.jobs.run_due_app_backup` and stored under
`<DATA_DIR>/backups` (the `app_data` volume the web and worker containers
share), newest N kept. The passphrase is stored encrypted in `AppSettings`
— needed to write a backup unattended, never shown again.

This protects against a bad change or a broken database, not against
losing the host: the files sit next to the application. Copy them off the
machine (the REST API lists and serves them) for that.
