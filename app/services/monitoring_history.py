"""Turns a honeypot's raw `HoneypotMonitoringSample` history into the
downsampled series the Monitoring tab's graphs actually render.

A honeypot sampled every `MONITORING_INTERVAL_SECONDS` (2 minutes by
default) accumulates ~720 rows/day — a 90-day view is ~65,000 rows, far
more points than an SVG sparkline (or a human) can usefully show. Rather
than have Postgres or the ORM do time-bucketed aggregation (which would
need either a raw/dialect-specific query or pulling in a real
time-series-friendly extension neither this app nor its SQLite test
backend has), this fetches the raw rows in the requested window (capped —
see `MAX_RAW_SAMPLES`) and downsamples them in Python by simple
positional bucketing (every consecutive run of rows averaged into one
point) — not time-aligned buckets, just "spread evenly across however many
rows came back," which is good enough for a *trend* line and keeps this
portable and dependency-free.

Network/disk I/O are stored as cumulative counters (bytes since boot —
see `app.ssh.monitoring`'s module docstring), so a *rate* (bytes/sec) is
computed here from the delta between each consecutive pair of samples,
before downsampling — a counter that went backwards (device/interface
reset, e.g. a reboot) or a non-positive time delta yields a gap (`None`)
for that point rather than a nonsensical negative or infinite rate.
