"""Something-changed-go-check push notifications over Redis pub/sub —
what makes a honeypot's Overview/Monitoring/Updates tabs update the moment a
background job finishes, instead of waiting out their htmx polling
interval (see `app/web/routes/live_ws.py`, the WebSocket that relays these
to the browser, and `app/web/static/js/live-updates.js`, the client that
turns one into an htmx re-fetch of the matching panel).

Deliberately minimal: a published message carries only a `kind` — never
honeypot data. A client that receives one just re-triggers the matching
htmx panel's own `hx-get` (still permission/scope-checked exactly like its
periodic poll already was); this channel is a doorbell, not a data feed,
so there's nothing sensitive in it and no risk of a push payload drifting
out of sync with what a fresh fetch would show.

Called from two different worlds: the FastAPI process (which has a
long-lived `app.state.redis`) and Celery worker processes (separate OS
processes entirely, each running these jobs' `asyncio.run(...)` wrapper —
see `app.tasks.jobs`'s module docstring). Rather than plumb `app.state`
through to worker code that has no `app` object, this opens its own
short-lived Redis connection per publish. That's more round trips than
reusing a shared connection, but publishes happen at most a few times per
job (not per SSH byte), and it keeps this module usable from anywhere
without a FastAPI request/app in scope.
