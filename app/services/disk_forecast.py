"""When will a filesystem fill up? A least-squares linear trend of each
mount's used bytes over the last `WINDOW` of monitoring samples,
extrapolated to its size.

Recomputed hourly per honeypot (`app.tasks.jobs.forecast_honeypot_disks`)
and stored on `Honeypot.disk_forecast`, so the Monitoring tab, the honeypot
list and the REST API read one small JSON value instead of re-scanning a
week of samples on every page load. Ported from debcontrol.

Deliberately simple: a straight line over a week says "at this rate," not
"this will definitely happen" — a log rotation or a cleanup job resets it,
and the next recomputation picks that up.
