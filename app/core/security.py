"""Encryption for sensitive data stored in the database (per-honeypot SSH
passwords/keys, the app's own SSH identity key, LDAP/OIDC client secrets,
NetBird/WireGuard config, TOTP secrets — every `LargeBinary` `*_encrypted`
column across `app/db/models/`).

New values are encrypted with **AES-256-GCM** (`cryptography`'s
`AESGCM`) — a random 12-byte nonce per value, keyed with the full 32 raw
bytes behind `ENCRYPTION_KEY`. `decrypt_secret` also still reads the
**Fernet** (AES-128-CBC + HMAC-SHA256) format every value here was
encrypted with before this change, so nothing already in the database
needs an immediate migration — `scripts/reencrypt_secrets.py` proactively
upgrades every remaining legacy value in one pass for a deployment that
wants none left, but running it is optional, not required, and nothing
here ever silently re-encrypts a value just because it was read.

Why AES-256, not just keep Fernet: Fernet's own construction always
splits its 32-byte key into two 16-byte halves and only ever encrypts
with the AES-**128** half — the other half only ever signs. AES-256-GCM
uses the full 32 bytes as a single AES-256 key, and (being AEAD) needs no
separate MAC step. See wiki/Architecture.md's "FIPS alignment" section for
the full reasoning — both AES-128 and AES-256 are themselves FIPS-approved
ciphers; this is a "prefer the modern default", not a "fixing something
broken", change.

`ENCRYPTION_KEY` itself is unchanged — still whatever
`scripts/generate_secrets.py` has always produced
(`Fernet.generate_key()`, a url-safe-base64-encoded 32 random bytes), just
now also decoded straight to those 32 raw bytes for AES-256-GCM rather
than handed to `Fernet()` as-is. No new environment variable, no key
rotation needed to pick this up.

The key is NEVER stored in the DB or the repo — only in `ENCRYPTION_KEY`
in the environment.

Note: this is NOT a substitute for authenticating/authorizing users of this
app — that's a separate concern. It only protects data at rest in Postgres.
