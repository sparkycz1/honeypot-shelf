"""Version metadata shown on the Settings page — a plain "which version is
this, exactly" answer after `scripts/upgrade.sh` (or any other deploy) pulls
a new release.

`APP_VERSION` is bumped by hand per release — there's no automated semantic
versioning yet, just a string here that should track the git tag. The git
commit itself is captured two different ways depending on how the app is
running:

- In the Docker image (built via `./scripts/upgrade.sh` or a plain
  `docker compose build`), it's baked in as the `GIT_COMMIT` build arg,
  which becomes an `ENV` in the image (see `Dockerfile`) — the `.git`
  directory itself is never copied in.
- Running locally without Docker (`uv run uvicorn ...`), `GIT_COMMIT` isn't
  set, so this falls back to asking the local git checkout directly.
