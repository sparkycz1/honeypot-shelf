"""OIDC login — standard authorization-code flow via Authlib, which also
validates the ID token's signature and nonce for us (it knows the provider's
JWKS once it's fetched `server_metadata_url`).

No account is ever created from this — see the module docstring on
`app.db.models.user`. `handle_callback` only returns the provider's claims;
matching that to an existing Honeypot Shelf account (by comparing
`AppSettings.oidc_username_claim`) happens in the route
(`app/web/routes/auth.py`), same as it would for any other claim-based
identity check.

A fresh `OAuth()` client is registered from current `AppSettings` on every
call rather than once at startup, since the config is editable at runtime
from the Settings page — the cost is one extra discovery-document fetch per
login, which is an acceptable trade for picking up config changes (or a
newly-enabled/disabled provider) without restarting the app.

Authlib's Starlette integration stores the OAuth `state`/`nonce` in
`request.session` — that's Starlette's own `SessionMiddleware`, registered in
`app.main` with `SECRET_KEY`, and is unrelated to the app's own login
sessions (`app.auth.sessions`), which is what a completed OIDC login itself
sets up once `handle_callback` and the username match succeed.
