"""Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH) guard for the cookie-
authenticated WebSockets (`terminal_ws.py`, `initialize_ws.py`, `live_ws.py`).

A WebSocket handshake is not subject to CORS and never passes through
`app.core.csrf` (no form, no token), so the session cookie is the only
thing standing between a hostile page and a live shell on a honeypot.
`SameSite=Strict` on that cookie already stops a *cross-site* page from
riding it — but "site" is the registrable domain, so a page on
a sibling subdomain (`evil.example.com` next to `honeypots.example.com`)
is same-site and would still get the cookie attached. Browsers always send
an `Origin` header on a WebSocket handshake and page scripts can't forge
it, so requiring it to name this very host closes that gap.

A handshake with no `Origin` at all is let through: that is never a
browser (so no ambient cookie to hijack), and such a client still needs a
valid session cookie of its own to get any further.

The comparison is against the request's own `Host` header — the same
assumption `app.auth.webauthn.rp_id_and_origin` already makes (a reverse
proxy must pass `Host` through unchanged; every proxy recipe in the wiki
does).
