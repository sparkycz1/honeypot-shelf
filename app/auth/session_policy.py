"""The sign-in policy set on Settings -> Security: session lifetime, the
failed-attempt lockout, and which networks may reach the app at all.

The session lifetime and the network allowlist are consulted on every
authenticated request (`app.auth.middleware`), so the policy is cached in
process for a few seconds instead of costing an extra `app_settings`
query per request. A save on the Settings page calls `invalidate()` so the
process that handled it applies the change at once; other worker processes
pick it up within `_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS`. Ported from debcontrol.
