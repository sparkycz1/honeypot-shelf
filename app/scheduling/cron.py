"""Standard 5-field cron expression handling for scheduled tasks.

A schedule is read in its task's own time zone (`ScheduledTask.timezone`,
an IANA name such as `Europe/Prague`) — "0 3 * * *" means 03:00 there,
summer and winter alike. A task without one (every task saved before
0.54.0) keeps running in UTC, exactly as before. Ported from debcontrol. Every computed time is
returned in UTC, like every other timestamp this app stores.

Across a daylight-saving change croniter follows the wall clock: a time
that doesn't exist that night (02:30 when clocks jump 02:00 → 03:00) runs
at the next valid minute, and one that happens twice runs once.
