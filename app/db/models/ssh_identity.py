"""The application's own shared SSH identity.

debcontrol connects to managed honeypots using one SSH keypair that belongs
to the application itself, rather than a separate key per honeypot.
Distributing the *public* half to honeypots (appending it to
`~/.ssh/authorized_keys`) is a manual step for an operator today — see the
wiki page "Honeypot Requirements".

The private key is generated once, on first use, and stored encrypted
(`app.core.security.encrypt_secret`) — never in plaintext, never on disk.
This is a singleton table: exactly one row, with a fixed id.

Rotation (see `app.ssh.identity.generate_pending_identity`/
`activate_pending_identity`) works by generating a *second* keypair into the
`pending_*` columns alongside the active one, rather than replacing the
active key immediately — every already-configured honeypot's
`authorized_keys` still only has the old public key until an operator adds
the new one, so switching the active key before that would lock the app out
of every honeypot at once. The pending key sits there (visible on the
Settings page for the operator to copy into `authorized_keys`) until they
confirm it's rolled out and activate it, which moves it into the `public_key`/
`private_key_encrypted`/`fingerprint` columns and clears `pending_*`.
