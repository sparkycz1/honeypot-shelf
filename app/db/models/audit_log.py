class AuditLogEntry(Base):
    """One row per audited event. Written once and never updated — see
    `app.audit.log_event`, the only place that creates these.

    `actor` holds the logged-in username responsible for the action, filled
    in automatically by `app.audit.log_event` from `request.state.user` (see
    `app.auth.middleware`) — still nullable, since a background job with no
    request (a scheduled task firing on its own) sets a fixed actor label
    instead (see `app.scheduling.jobs._SCHEDULER_ACTOR`), and a handful of
    entries predate logins existing at all. `ip_address` is the request's
    source IP either way.

    `target_id`/`target_type` are plain strings, not foreign keys: the
    honeypot/company/user an entry refers to can later be renamed or
    deleted, and the audit trail must survive that unchanged. `target_label`
    is a snapshot of its human-readable name taken at the time of the
    event, for exactly the same reason.

    `created_at` is assigned in Python (`datetime.now(UTC)`), not via a DB
    `server_default` like most other timestamps in this app — `app.audit.
    log_event` needs the exact value *before* the row is inserted, since
    it's part of what `entry_hash` covers; a server-assigned default
    wouldn't be known until after the write.

    `sequence`/`prev_hash`/`entry_hash` form the hash chain: `entry_hash` is
    a SHA-256 over this entry's own fields plus the previous entry's
    `entry_hash`, so altering or removing an entry breaks the chain from
    that point on in a way `app.audit.verify_chain` can detect. All three
    are nullable only because a handful of entries were written before this
    chaining existed (there's no going back to hash entries that already
    happened) — every entry written by the current `log_event` always
    populates them.
