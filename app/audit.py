"""Audit logging — the single write path for `AuditLogEntry`, and hash-chain
verification.

Every route or background job that mutates something, or that refuses to
because a safeguard tripped (a typed confirmation that didn't match, a
missing pinned host key, a bad self-registration token, a failed login),
calls `log_event` right after. `actor` is filled in automatically from the
logged-in user on the request (see `log_event`'s docstring) — routes don't
need to pass it themselves; a background job (the scheduler, the retention
purge) passes a fixed label instead, since it has no request/user at all.

Every entry is hash-chained: `entry_hash` covers this entry's own fields
plus the previous entry's `entry_hash`, so altering or deleting an entry
breaks the chain from that point on — `verify_chain` below detects that.
Writers (possibly in different processes — the web app and every Celery
worker child both log events) serialize through `AuditChainState`, a one-row table
locked with `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` for the duration of one entry's write,
so two concurrent entries can never both link to the same previous hash.

`log_event` commits independently of whatever the caller is doing — call it
*after* the caller's own commit (if any), never before, so a failed audit
write can never roll back the action it's describing, and a validation
failure that made nothing else worth committing still gets its own record.
