"""Guards against the whole class of bug `app.db.pg_enum` exists to fix:
a native-enum column silently binding a Python enum member's `.name`
(SQLAlchemy's default) instead of its `.value`, which matches nothing a
migration ever created on real Postgres and is completely invisible
against the SQLite backend these tests otherwise run against — see
app/db/pg_enum.py's module docstring for the full story.

This walks every mapped model's columns rather than hardcoding the current
ones, so a future native-enum column that reintroduces a bare
`sqlalchemy.Enum(...)` (instead of `pg_enum(...)`) fails here immediately,
without needing a real Postgres to notice.
