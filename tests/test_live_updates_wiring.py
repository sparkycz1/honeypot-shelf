"""Regression guard for the live-update WebSocket wiring — the browser
half (`app/web/static/js/live-updates.js`), every template that opts into
it, and the server route it connects to (`app/web/routes/live_ws.py`).
These are three separately-edited files agreeing on the same data
attribute names and URL shape, with nothing enforcing that at runtime — a
mismatch fails silently (the socket simply never opens, or the script
finds no anchor and no-ops entirely), with no error anywhere a human
would notice short of watching the browser console. See
wiki/Architecture.md's "Live updates over WebSocket, and 'Refresh now'"
section.

This is exactly the class of bug this app shipped with from its very
first commit, found live this session: a debcontrol leftover — the JS's
selector/URL never got updated to match this app's own `data-live-
honeypot-id` attribute and `/honeypots/{id}/live/ws` route — silently
left every page's live-update socket a permanent no-op behind an
always-on polling fallback, with zero errors anywhere, for as long as
nobody happened to open the browser console."""
